Node.js is an up and coming server side platform built from Javascript that will allow to create network 
applications. Features of Node.js is that it is event driven while being asynchronous. So that means
 the server never waits to return data. Node.js is related to javascript because it uses the 
javascript language library and adds a runtime environment.
